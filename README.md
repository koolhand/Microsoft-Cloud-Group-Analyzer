# Microsoft Cloud Group Analyzer

Entra ID Groups are often used in multiple locations in your environment and used by multiple admins. Without continuously updating documentation or syncing with other admins, you’re all using groups blindly, potentially causing unintended security or user impact through changes in group memberships. Therefore, I've created this script.

For **Microsoft Cloud admins** who **struggle to keep track of where Entra ID groups are used**, Group Analyzer is an **opensource script** that provides **instant insights in what services/policies/... a given group or user is scoped to**.

<a href="./readme/mcga.png" target="_blank"><img src="./readme/mcga.png" width="100%" /></a>

Group Analyzer is an essential script for Microsoft Cloud Administrators seeking comprehensive visibility into the usage of Entra ID groups across their environment. By providing detailed insights, this tool empowers admins to:

- **Prevent Unintended Impacts:** Safeguard against inadvertent membership modifications in groups that could trigger unexpected configuration changes in various services.
- **Enhance Group Management:** Maintain a clear overview of group assignments, ensuring efficient and informed management of your cloud environment.
- **Save time:** Don't spend time going over all of your policies and services looking where a certain Entra ID group is used.
- **Feel in control:** To be certain and have confirmation that you are not adding users to groups, causing unforseen impact.

## What's in scope?

Group Analyzer lists group memberships for following services:

## Installation and usage

<a href="./readme/mcga-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="./readme/mcga-1.png" width="60%" /></a> <br>
<a href="./readme/mcga-2.png" target="_blank"><img src="./readme/mcga-2.png" width="60%" /></a> <br>
<a href="./readme/mcga-3.png" target="_blank"><img src="./readme/mcga-3.png" width="60%" /></a> <br>


```sh
git clone https://github.com/jasperbaes/Microsoft-Cloud-Group-Analyzer.git
cd ./Microsoft-Cloud-Group-Analyzer
npm install
```

## Usage

There are 2 ways to authenticate:
- with an admin account (run 'az login' in your terminal. You might not have all required permissions assigned!)
- with an Azure App registration (create an Azure App Registration with all .Read.All permissions and fill credentials in the .env file)

```
CLIENTSECRET=<app secret>
TENANTID=<your tenant ID>
CLIENTID=<app registration ID>
```

To run the script:

```sh
az login    <-- only if you use admin account authentication
node index.js
```

Now paste a group ID, a user ID or the word 'all'.

 | Option            |               example                |                                                     Description |
 | ----------------- | :----------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------: |
 | Entra ID Group ID | 99ccbd7e-0fc9-4545-8cf9-ee89191ed78d |                       The given group will be taken in scope ID |
 | Entra ID User ID  | caf7b774-c8ab-47c3-a39e-d0a0d85d6423 | All groups where the given user is member of are taken in scope |
 | 'all'             |                 all                  |              This option will take all Entra ID groups in scope |

## Roadmap
- [x] Caching (local)
- [ ] Authentication methods
  - [x] User authentication
  - [ ] Azure App Registration certificate authentication
  - [ ] Managed Identity
- [ ] Webinterface
- [ ] Export
  - [ ] CSV
  - [ ] JSON
- [ ] Ennumerate the actual setting, not assignment only
- [ ] Cronjob / call from existing service
